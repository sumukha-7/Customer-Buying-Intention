# Customer-Buying-Intention
It is a Machine Learning project in which we used a dataset containing details of the customer activity on multiple websites such as: bounce rates, exit rates, click rates, operating systems, etc., and implemented multiple ML models to predict whether the customer would buy a product or not.
